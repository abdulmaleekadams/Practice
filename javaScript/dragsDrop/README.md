## Introduction

This project showcases the drag-and-drop functionality, allowing you to drag items from the left container to the right container and vice versa. It's a basic example that can serve as a starting point for more complex drag-and-drop interactions in your web applications.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop items between two containers.
- Visually appealing user interface with colorful elements.
- Easy-to-understand JavaScript code for handling drag-and-drop events.

## Usage

To use the drag-and-drop application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

3. You will see two containers: "left" and "right." Items in the "left" container can be dragged to the "right" container, and vice versa.

4. Click and drag any of the "List" items to the other container. Release the mouse button to drop the item.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the drag-and-drop application by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files. Here are a few customization options:

- Change the colors and styles of the containers and list items in `style.css`.
- Modify the drag-and-drop logic or add additional functionality in `script.js`.

```css
/* Example customization in style.css */
.container {
  background: #0b0423; /* Change the background color */
}

.list {
  background: #e63d3d; /* Change the list item background color */
